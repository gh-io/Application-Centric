description: Application-centric blockchains with programmable onchain sequencers
---

Appchains are sovereign execution environments optimized for a single application or ecosystem.

Unlike general-purpose blockchains, appchains align **execution, economics, and governance** directly with application intent.

This documentation describes an application-centric stack built around programmable onchain sequencers — enabling full customization without sacrificing atomic composability.
